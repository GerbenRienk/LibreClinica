# T015: double data entry
**Abstract:**  
This documents contains the definitions for tests that concern double data entry, or DDE. DDE works according to the base rule that entry 1, DE1, and entry 2, DE2, must be identical. DE1 indicates that the first entry is finished by selecting the checkbox **Mark CRF Complete** and saving it. If DE2 differs from DE1, then an error message is displayed upon clicking **Save**. If the data aren't changed and the user clicks **Save** again, then the data of DE2 are saved to the database.

**prerequisite:**  
DDE can be performed by both Data Specialists / Investigators and Data Entry Persons / Clinical Research Coordinators. For these tests you can take both options, or a combination.    
In order to do these tests you must have a Study with at least two non-repeating and two repeating events. Assigned to each event must be a CRF with at least one non-repeating-item-group and one repeating-item-group. Each group should have at least one item that is not of data-type string, for example date or integer.  
Make all four combinations for non-repeating / repeating event against without / with at least one null-value:

| combination | event type | null |
| -- | -- | -- |
| **A** | non-repeating event | no null-values |
| **B** | repeating event | no null-values |
| **C** | non-repeating event | null-values |
| **D** | repeating event | null-values |

Furthermore you must have two logins, normal users, with data-entry roles, **Data Entry Person** or **Data Specialist**.

## T015-01: identical data should be accepted
**description:**  
This test focuses on data where DE1 and DE2 are identical. 

**prerequisite:**  
See above

**workflow:**  
1. login as DE1
1. select a subject N
1. complete one CRF of type **A** and at least two CRF's of type **B**, choosing all unique, normal values
1. login as DE2
1. select subject N
1. complete the CRF's of type **A** and **B** with exactly the same values
1. login as DE1
1. select a subject O
1. complete one CRF of type **C** and at least two CRF's of type **D**, choosing all null-values
1. login as DE2
1. select subject O
1. complete the CRF's of type **C** and **D** with exactly the same null-values
1. login as DE1
1. select a subject P
1. complete one CRF of type **A** and **C** plus at least two CRF's of type **B** and **D**, entering no values
1. login as DE2
1. select subject P
1. complete the CRF's of type **A, B, C** and **D** entering no values

**testdata:**  
N.a.

**expected results:**  
The status of all CRF's should be **Initial Data Entry Completed**.  
Verify that the account name of the first data entry is in column **Initial Data Entry**.


## T015-02: non-identical data should result in a message
**description:**  
This test focuses on data where DE1 and DE2 are not identical. 8 subjects are used, Q to X, that all represent a difference between DE1 and DE2. For example in the diagram subject R will have as DE1 normal values and as DE2 null-values. And subject X will have no values for DE1 and a null-value for DE2.

|   | **DE2 normal** | **DE2 null-value** | **DE2 empty** |
| -- | -- | -- |-- |
| **DE1 normal**       | Q | R | S |
| **DE1 null-value**   | T | U | V |
| **DE1 empty**        | W | X | n.a. |

**prerequisite:**  
See above

**workflow:**  
1. login as DE1

1. complete one CRF of type **A** and at least two CRF's of type **B**, choosing all unique, normal values
1. login as DE2
1. select subject Q
1. complete the CRF's of type **A** and **B**, choosing all normal values, different from DE1
1. login as DE1
1. select subject R
1. complete one CRF of type **C** and at least two CRF's of type **D**, choosing all unique, normal values
1. login as DE2
1. select subject R
1. complete the CRF's of type **C** and **D**, choosing all null-values
1. login as DE1
1. select subject S
1. complete one CRF of type **A** and at least two CRF's of type **B**, choosing all unique, normal values
1. login as DE2
1. select subject S

1. login as DE1
1. select subject T
1. complete one CRF of type **C** and at least two CRF's of type **D**, choosing all null-values
1. login as DE2
1. select subject T
1. complete the CRF's of type **C** and **D**, choosing all unique, normal values
1. login as DE1
1. select subject U
1. complete one CRF of type **C** and at least two CRF's of type **D**, choosing all null-values
1. login as DE2
1. select subject U
1. complete the CRF's of type **C** and **D**, choosing all null-values, different from DE1
1. login as DE1
1. select subject V
1. complete one CRF of type **C** and at least two CRF's of type **D**, choosing all null-values
1. login as DE2
1. select subject V
1. complete the CRF's of type **C** and **D**, entering no values
1. login as DE1
1. select subject W
1. complete one CRF of type **A** and at least two CRF's of type **B**, entering no values
1. login as DE2
1. select subject W
1. complete the CRF's of type **A** and **B**, choosing all normal values
1. login as DE1

1. login as DE2
1. select subject X
1. complete the CRF's of type **C** and **D**, choosing all null-values

**testdata:**  
N.a.

**expected results:**  
When in DE2 clicking **Save**, a message  **[The value you specify does not match the value: x from initial data entry]** should appear in all cases.
After saving the data as DE2, verify that the data have been stored correctly by clicking on the magnifier-icon, **View**, to the right of the crf and comparing the values.  
Verify that the account name of the second data entry is in column **Double Data Entry**.
